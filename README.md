    For each of the following two queries, create a relational algebra query file:

        List the firstname and lastname of employee(s) with the lowest salary value. -- [filename: q2.alg]

    Create a domain relational calculus query file for the following query:
        List the last names of managers of departments that employ at least one employee with 'SPOUSE' as a dependent. -- [filename: q3.drc]

    Create a tuple relational calculus query file for the following query:
        List the firstname and lastname of employee(s) who has the highest hours on works_on. -- [filenames: q4.trc]


Use WinRDBI to test the queries.
